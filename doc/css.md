# The CSS

CSS includes:

* [Normalize.css](#normalizecss) from HTML5 boilerplate
* [Main.css](#maincss) Website main styles


## Normalize.css

In order to make browsers render all elements more consistently and in line
with modern standards, we include
[Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) â€” a modern, HTML5-ready
alternative to CSS resets.

As opposed to CSS resets, Normalize.css:

* targets only the styles that need normalizing
* preserves useful browser defaults rather than erasing them
* corrects bugs and common browser inconsistencies
* improves usability with subtle improvements
* doesn't clutter the debugging tools
* has better documentation

For more information about Normalize.css, please refer to its [project
page](https://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/), as well as this
[blog post](http://nicolasgallagher.com/about-normalize-css/).
